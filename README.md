# Itten color

The Itten Color Circle is a 12-hue color wheel developed by Bauhaus master Johannes Itten, organizing colors into primaries (red, yellow, blue), secondaries (orange, green, violet), and tertiaries, demonstrating relationships and harmonies for artists and designers. It's a foundational tool for understanding color mixing, contrast (warm/cool, complementary), and creating balanced palettes, showing how all colors derive from basic pigments.

## Key Components of Itten's Circle

- _Primary Colors (First Order)_: Red, Yellow, Blue – the foundational colors from which others are mixed.
- _Secondary Colors (Second Order)_: Orange, Green, Violet – formed by mixing equal parts of two primaries (e.g., Red + Yellow = Orange).
- _Tertiary Colors (Third Order)_: Yellow-Orange, Red-Orange, Red-Violet, Blue-Violet, Blue-Green, Yellow-Green – created by mixing a primary with an adjacent secondary color.

## How It's Used

- _Color Relationships:_ Visually maps how colors relate to each other, with complementary colors (like yellow and violet) directly opposite on the wheel.
- _Color Harmonies:_ Helps identify harmonious combinations, such as triads (e.g., Red, Yellow, Blue) that blend to a neutral gray.
- _Contrast:_ Demonstrates warm (reds, yellows) vs. cool (blues, greens) colors and other contrasts (light/dark, saturation).
- _Art & Design:_ A core teaching tool at Bauhaus, influencing artists and designers to create depth, mood, and visual interest in their work
